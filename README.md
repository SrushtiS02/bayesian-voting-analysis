# 🗳️ Bayesian Voting Analysis

This project explores the relationship between **depression prevalence** and **Republican voting patterns** across US counties using **Bayesian regression modeling**. Developed as part of the *Applied Statistical Modelling* module at Trinity College Dublin.

---

## 📊 Objective

To investigate how mental health and race demographics influence voting behavior using interpretable Bayesian statistics.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `scripts/analysis.R` – Core code performing EDA, linear models, and Bayesian regression using `brms`.
- `data/USvotes.csv` – Cleaned dataset including mental health and voting data per US county.
- `plots/` – Visualizations of regression estimates and uncertainty.

---

## 🔍 Techniques Used

- Bayesian modeling with `brms`
- Visualization with `ggplot2` & `bayesplot`
- Data cleaning and wrangling using `tidyverse`
- Interpretation of posterior distributions and credible intervals

---

## 📈 Key Outcomes

- Built interpretable Bayesian regression models with credible intervals
- Visualized the influence of depression and race on GOP vote share
- Developed insights into how social factors may impact political leanings

---

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated

- R programming
- Bayesian inference
- Data storytelling
- Statistical modeling & communication
